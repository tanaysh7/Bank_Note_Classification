## Bank Note Classification

**Objective** : Perform Active, Passive Learning and Monte Carlo Simulation on Bank Note Classification problem

- Active Learning : Incremental Learning by adding the most uncertain data points wrt to current model to the training pool.
- Passive Learning : Incremental Learning by randomly adding more data points to the training pool.

**Data** : Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.
